# Fibonacci Sequence

Implement the `fibonacci` function that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1. For example, the sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

### Example:

Given the input `n = 5`, the function should return `5`:

```rust
let result = fibonacci(5);  // 5
