# Pybites Rust Bites

Thanks for stopping by. This repo allows you to suggest ideas for exercises and write your own.

## How to suggest an idea

1. Create an issue with the exercise description
2. If you want to write the test and solution code, mention this in the issue or wait for someone to pick it up

## How to write your own exercise

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new directory with the exercise name (use underscores) copying the _template_ directory
3. Write the code including tests in a single main.rs file (see example files in the _template_ directory)
4. Add a exercise.md file with the exercise description and any hints (see example in the _template_ directory)
5. Open a PR with your new exercise, we will review it and merge it in. After merge we will add it to the platform.

Happy coding and let's learn Rust together! ðŸ¦€
